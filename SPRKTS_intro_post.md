Welcome to SPRKTS! (start here...)

## Hullo! Welcome to SPRKTS, a brand new (currently super-tiny!) community of bikers in and around Bristol.

### Why SPRKTS? Why not just join a regular motorcycle club?

True, there are lots of motorcycle clubs in Bristol, and some of them are awesome. There are the sportsbike Power Rangers who want to just plain *ride*, and ride super fast, but to not really do anything else. There are the leathery, beardy old cruiser guys who are probably having loads of fun but just look, well, kinda terrifying! There's Bristol Biking Girls, who are awesome and friendy and diverse (and if you're a girl you should totally join) but we want a group that's open to people of all genders.

What we want for SPRKTS is to create a group that combines the best attributes of all these different sorts of club. We want to create rideouts to go on. We want to create events and fun stuff to do as well as just riding (why ride around in basically a huge circle for four hours when instead you can ride to (say) a gig in Weston or Calne or Glastonbury in a couple of hours, enjoy a summer evening socialising with friends, chatting about bikes and listening to live music, still buzzing with fresh adrenaline from the ride out there, and then afterwards blat home on the M4 or M5 in less than half an hour, the last song still ringing in your ears?) We want to create a group where you can ask for advice, even super basic advice, without being ignored or laughed-at, and where you can feel comfortable asking if somebody can lend you a hand with a tricky bit of bike maintenance. We want to create a community where everybody is welcome, so long as they love riding or being around motorcycles. And most of all - *we want you along for the ride*!

### How does SPRKTS work? What are the different channels for?

SPRKTS is very small, and very new. (If you're reading this, it means you're basically in at the beginning!) Our current pan/setup is:

A forum: this is the *sprkts-bristol* text channel. We plan for this to be the main focal point of SPRKTS; we chose this because
